# COVID-19 Trend Analysis for India

This project explores COVID-19 trends in India using Python and visualizations. I cleaned and analyzed real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), created insightful plots, and shared key takeaways — all while learning and growing through hands-on practice.

## Key Visuals
- Daily new cases and deaths
- Vaccination progress
- Test positivity rates
- Trends over time with annotations

## What I Learned
- Data cleaning with Pandas
- Plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Handling large datasets
- Telling a story through visuals and markdown

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git & GitHub

## Files
- `covid_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, plots, and commentary
- `covid_analysis.py`: Script version of the notebook
- `owid-covid-data.csv`: Source dataset (large file)
- `Fig_1.png` to `Fig_5.png`: Saved plots
- `covid_trend_plot.png`: Summary visualization

## My Journey
I built this project to deepen my skills in data storytelling and visualization. Every plot reflects a step in my learning — from wrangling messy data to making insights clear and visual. I’ve edited the markdown and code to feel personal, not AI-generated, because I want my work to reflect my growth.
